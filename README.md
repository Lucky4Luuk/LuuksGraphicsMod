# Luuks Graphics Mod
A graphics mod for BeamNG, capable of loading custom shaderpacks.

## Planned Features
- Custom settings for shaderpacks.
- Disabling vanilla effects through shaderpack settings.
- MAYBE: Loading shaderpacks from zip files.

## Known Issues
- When reloading shaders, the uniforms won't update anymore. A temporary fix is to switch to a different shader, and reload shaders again, and then switch back.
- Using a texture supplied by the mod, such as `rgba_noise_small`, might lead to absurdly long load times. More complicated shaders relying on sampling that texture might take minutes to load! If you happen to have this issue with a shader, feel free to send me a message on Discord (see [Support](#support)).

## Support
If you need support with this mod (or any of my other mods), feel free to ask your questions on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mVcQAR4CFH). You can also reach me on the BeamNG forums, but I'm significantly less active there.
